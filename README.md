# Emacs Configuration Files
My emacs configuration, inspired by [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).

### Description
Spacemacs is unfortunately too slow for my taste and it was too hard to strip
down the unnecessary things. I cherry-picked the best things from it and threw
everything else away. Mainly uses
[general.el](https://github.com/noctuid/general.el) and
[use-package.el](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package). Careful attention was
paid to keep loading time down by making aggressive use of laziness features of
`use-package`.
