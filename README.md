# emacs-dotfiles
My emacs dotfile, inspired by spacemacs.

Spacemacs is unfortunately too slow for my taste and it was too hard to strip down the unnecessary things.
I cherry-picked the best things from it and threw everything else away. Mainly uses general.el and use-package.el.
Careful attenation was paid to keep loading time down by making aggressive use of laziness features of use-package.
